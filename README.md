## Description

In this project, we intend to first generate depth maps from input video. Using these depth maps,
we plan to create refocusable videos.

With these refocusable videos, we can simulate human vision but with a more cinematic DoF using
eye tracking technology where the video will place more emphasis on whichever subject a viewer
looks at.

## Installation

## Further Information

For a camera, Depth of Field(DoF) is the distance between the nearest and farthest object in focus.
The depth of field in a video depends on numerous factors such as focal length, aperture, distance to
subject, etc. The human eye too has a depth of field. DoF is generally extremely wide for objects
more than a few meters away, meaning that everything is in focus at the same time.
For near objects, the DoF is very shallow, giving rise to the cinematic focus effect we see in movies.
The DoF in cinematic videography is done using specialized lenses and scripted positioning of
subjects. Mobile phone videos do not have this positioning planned beforehand and thus the cameras
have a wide DoF as the default. Mobile phone camera’s don’t have readily available interchangeable
lenses either, preventing daily users to use the optimal lens for the subject.
